## Mission & Vision

Mission: "We exist to glorify God through the fulfillment of the Great Commission in the spirit of the Great Commandment."

Vision: "Our vision is to be a church that is faithfully committed to making more disciples and stronger disciples of Jesus Christ with an effective witness and mutual ministry."

The mission is unashamedly unoriginal - it comes directly from Jesus:
- The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20): Making disciples of all nations
- The Great Commandment (Matthew 22:37-40): Love God and love your neighbor

## Our Four Pillars

1. Unapologetic Preaching - Proclaiming the authority of God's Word without apology (2 Timothy 4:2)
2. Unashamed Worship - Lifting high the name of Jesus through worship (John 4:24)
3. Unceasing Prayer - Believing firmly in the power of prayer (Ephesians 6:18)
4. Unafraid Witness - Sharing the good news of Jesus with boldness (Ephesians 6:19-20)

## Our Four Principles

Vertical Church makes disciples of Jesus by encouraging them to:

1. Worship Christ - Worshiping together as a community through music, prayer, and the preaching of God's Word every weekend
2. Walk with Christ - Growing in community through Small Groups where you experience fellowship, study God's Word, and mutual ministry
3. Work for Christ - Using time, energy, and talents to build the Kingdom of God and care for one another
4. Witness for Christ - Sharing the Good News about Jesus Christ in loving and intentional ways

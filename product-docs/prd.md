### Mission Statement

> "We exist to glorify God through the fulfillment of the Great Commission in the spirit of the Great Commandment."

The mission is **unashamedly unoriginal** — because it's not theirs to come up with. Jesus laid out the mission for His church 2,000 years ago:

- **The Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19–20): "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
- **The Great Commandment** (Matthew 22:37–40): "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind... You shall love your neighbor as yourself."

---

### Vision

> "Our vision is to be a church that is faithfully committed to making more disciples and stronger disciples of Jesus Christ with an effective witness and mutual ministry."

---

### Our Pillars

The four pillars that define Vertical Church's ministry approach:

| Pillar | Description | Scripture |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Unapologetic Preaching** | Proclaiming the authority of God's Word without apology | 2 Timothy 4:2 |
| **Unashamed Worship** | Lifting high the name of Jesus through worship | John 4:24 |
| **Unceasing Prayer** | Believing firmly in the power of prayer | Ephesians 6:18 |
| **Unafraid Witness** | Sharing the good news of Jesus with boldness | Ephesians 6:19–20 |

### Our Principles

Vertical Church makes disciples of Jesus by encouraging them to:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Worship Christ** | God's Word admonishes us to worship together regularly. We worship together as a community through music, prayer, and the preaching of God's Word every weekend. |
| **Walk with Christ** | Growing in your walk with Christ is best achieved in rich community. The Vertical Church family encourages everyone to join a Small Group where you experience fellowship, applicational study in God's Word, and mutual ministry. |
| **Work for Christ** | One of the great joys of being a disciple of Christ is by serving Christ and one another. We encourage all those in the Vertical Church family to use their time, energy, and talents to build the Kingdom of God and care for one another. |
| **Witness for Christ** | Sharing the Good News about Jesus Christ is a vital aspect in the life of a growing disciple. At Vertical Church we encourage believers to share the Gospel with those around us in loving and intentional ways. |

He created all things <Verses refs="Revelation 4:11" /> and upholds all things by the Word of His power <Verses refs="Hebrews 1:3" />. In Him we live and move and have our being <Verses refs="Acts 17:28" />. He is a God of truth and without iniquity. He is just and right <Verses refs="Deuteronomy 32:4" />, and He shall judge the world <Verses refs="Psalm 9:8" />.</div>
            <div>We believe that the Godhead eternally exists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one God, having precisely the same nature, attributes, and perfections, and are worthy of precisely the same homage, confidence, and obedience <Verses refs="Mark 12:29; John 1:1-4; Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 4:3-4" />.</div>

              We believe the Scriptures of the Old Testament and New Testament are verbally inspired by God and inerrant in their original writings. We believe the 66 books of the Old Testament and the New Testament are God's complete and sufficient revelation and therefore carry God's authority for the total well-being of mankind <Verses refs="Psalm 119:97-104; Psalm 119:160; Matthew 5:18; John 5:46-47; John 10:35; 2 Timothy 3:15-16" />.

              We believe man was created in innocence under the law of his Maker, but by voluntarily transgressing, fell from his sinless and happy state. Consequently, all mankind is sinful. All people are sinners not only by inheritance, but also by their own choice and therefore are under just condemnation without defense or excuse. We believe that without exception every man and every woman is totally depraved and needs a Savior <Verses refs="Genesis 3:1-6; Romans 3:10-19; Romans 1:18, 1:32" />.

His return has a vital bearing on the personal life and service of the believer <Verses refs="1 Thessalonians 4:13-18" />. We believe in the bodily resurrection of both the saved and the lost. The saved are raised to eternal, conscious bliss in heaven <Verses refs="Matthew 25:34; John 14:2; 2 Corinthians 5:1; Revelation 2:7" />. The lost are raised to eternal torment in hell in conscious separation from God <Verses refs="Matthew 8:12; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 13:49-50; Mark 9:47-48; Luke 12:5; Revelation 21:8" />.

We believe He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. We believe Him to be true God and true man <Verses refs="John 1:1, 1:14, 1:18; John 14:8-9; 1 Timothy 3:16" />.

            <div>
              We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ <Verses refs="John 16:14" />. The Holy Spirit regenerates the sinner upon belief in Christ, baptizing the believer into one body, of which Christ is the head. The Holy Spirit indwells, guides, instructs, fills, comforts, and empowers the believer for godly living <Verses refs="Mark 13:11; John 14:26; John 16:13; Romans 5:5; 1 Corinthians 3:16" />.

            <div>
              The Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, of God's righteousness, and of coming judgment <Verses refs="John 16:8-11" />. While we believe that the Scriptures do not teach that certain gifts have ceased, they indicate that use of the gifts vary according to the need that each gift meets. Gifts must be used in a way that is edifying and loving toward other believers <Verses refs="John 16:8; 13:15; Titus 3:5; Ephesians 1:22; 4:11-12; Romans 8:9-17; 12:4-8; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 12:4-5, 12:11-13, 12:19; Galatians 5:25; Hebrews 4:1-4; 2 Corinthians 12:12" />.

            <div>
              We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice. We believe that each person who by faith receives Him as personal Savior is justified on the basis of Jesus Christ's shed blood on the cross. Each person who receives Christ as personal Savior is born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby becomes eternally secure as a child of God. We believe the Holy Spirit baptizes each believing person into the body of Christ at the moment of salvation and that there is no second baptism of the Holy Spirit <Verses refs="Romans 8:37-39; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Corinthians 12:13" />.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              Upon accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, a believer becomes part of His body, which is the church. There is one church universal, composed of all those throughout the world who acknowledge Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. The Scriptures command believers to gather in order to devote themselves to worship, prayer, teaching of the Word, observance of the ordinances (baptism and communion), fellowship, service to the body through the development and use of talents and gifts, and outreach to the world in fulfillment of the command of Christ to disciple all believers <Verses refs="Ephesians 5:23; Romans 12:1; Acts 2:42-46; 1 Corinthians 14:26; Matthew 28:18-20" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              Wherever God's people meet regularly in obedience to this command, there is the local expression of the church under the oversight of elders and other supportive leadership. The church's members are to work together in love and unity, intent on the ultimate purpose of glorifying Christ <Verses refs="Ephesians 4:16" />.

            <div>
              We believe in the verbal, plenary inspiration of the Scriptures and that they contain all the words of God that we need in order to completely trust and obey Him. The Scriptures are inerrant in their original writings <Verses refs="Psalm 119:97-104; Psalm 119:160; Matthew 5:18; John 5:46-47; John 10:35; 2 Timothy 3:15-16" />, and are infallible in their instruction <Verses refs="Proverbs 6:32; 2 Peter 1:19" />, eternal in duration <Verses refs="Isaiah 40:8; 1 Peter 1:23-25" />; the final authority and the standard for faith and practice <Verses refs="Matthew 4:4; Psalm 119" />; and sufficient for counsel in every issue of life <Verses refs="Psalm 19:7-14; 2 Timothy 3:16" />. We believe that the very words of Scripture in the original Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic are inspired by God. Therefore, we believe that the Bible versions which translate God's Word most literally into modern English should be preferred.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              It is God's divine decision to save a person and it is God's kindness, forbearance, and patience that lead that person to repentance <Verses refs="Romans 2:4" />. All glory for the salvation and security of every believer belongs to God alone <Verses refs="Romans 3:21-31; Ephesians 1:7-9; Ephesians 2:8-9; Jude 1:24-25" />. We believe that everyone who is born again by the Spirit through Jesus Christ is eternally assured of salvation from the moment of conversion. This assurance relies on God's decisive grace rather than on the works of the Christian. Obedience, good works, and fruit-bearing do not earn or retain the believer's salvation but indicate the reality of the person's love of Christ and profession of faith <Verses refs="Luke 6:46; John 14:21; James 2:17-18" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              Eternal security in salvation relies on the Lord's guarantee of each believer's adoption as His son or daughter <Verses refs="Galatians 4:4-7" />, His seal of the believer by the Holy Spirit <Verses refs="2 Corinthians 1:21-22; Ephesians 1:13-14" />, and the conviction that God gives the Holy Spirit to each believer as a down payment toward future bliss in heaven <Verses refs="2 Corinthians 1:21-22" />. A person who professes genuine faith in Christ immediately becomes His possession <Verses refs="Luke 23:42-43; Acts 2:40-41; Acts 16:30-34" />, and nothing can snatch that person out of His hands <Verses refs="John 10:27-29" />. Having been bought with the price of Jesus Christ's crucifixion as complete payment for sin, Christians are not their own. They are Christ's possession <Verses refs="1 Corinthians 6:19-20" />. This assurance is absolutely certain, reserved in heaven, and protected by God's unlimited power <Verses refs="1 Peter 1:4-5" />.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              The chief purpose of mankind is to glorify God by loving Him with the entire heart, soul, mind, and might <Verses refs="Deuteronomy 6:5; Isaiah 43:7; Matthew 22:37" />. All believing men, women, and children are to glorify God and thus fulfill the purpose of their existence. Worship glorifies God through adoration <Verses refs="Psalm 95:6" />, praise <Verses refs="Psalm 99:5" />, prayer <Verses refs="Daniel 6:10-11" />, thanksgiving <Verses refs="Nehemiah 12:46" />, and a complete yielding to Him <Verses refs="Romans 12:1" />. Worship declares His worth, pays Him homage, and celebrates Him in a life of devotion. We seek to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth <Verses refs="Exodus 15:1-21; 2 Samuel 6:14-16; Psalm 5:7; John 4:23-24; Revelation 4:11; 5:12" />.
            </div>
            <div>Several tenets guide our worship. We seek to:</div>

              <li>Lift high the name of Jesus Christ <Verses refs="John 4:22-26; John 12:32; John 14:6" />.</li>
              <li>Lead God's people to lift their hearts and voices to Him, giving Him praise and thanks in music and lyrics <Verses refs="Nehemiah 12:45-46; Psalm 66:1-4; Psalm 95:1-2" />.</li>
              <li>Prepare hearts to hear the Lord speak through the proclamation of Scripture <Verses refs="Psalm 95:6-9; Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42" />.</li>
              <li>Emphasize fresh and contemporary expressions while retaining traditional elements that recognize the richness of our heritage in the faith <Verses refs="Deuteronomy 32:7; Psalm 33:3; Isaiah 46:8-9; Matthew 13:32; Ephesians 5:19; Revelation 5:9" />.</li>
              <li>Pursue excellence in worship, knowing that God is worthy of our best <Verses refs="Exodus 12; Deuteronomy 17:1; Psalm 33:3; 1 Timothy 4:14-15; Hebrews 11:4" />.</li>

            <div>
              The church exists to glorify God through the fulfillment of the Great Commission, and in the spirit of the Great Commandment <Verses refs="Matthew 28:19-20; Matthew 22:37-38" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              The Great Commission is fulfilled as disciples of Jesus Christ are made and grow in their relationship with Him and likeness to Him. God is glorified as we manifest His presence as we do His work <Verses refs="2 Timothy 2:2; 1 Corinthians 10:31" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              In seeking to act upon the church's purpose, we recognize the extraordinary value in multiplying the reach of His ministry by planting local churches and by associating with existing, like-minded local churches. God is glorified when Vertical Church and other like-minded churches associate with one another in order to foster relationships that edify, protect, encourage, support, and admonish.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              Mature disciples walk with Christ, worship Christ, and work for Christ. A person committed to a relationship with Christ focuses on a personal walk with Him, worshipping Him, working for Him, and being a witness for Him. That person will experience significant growth in personal sanctification and, therefore, will experience a closer personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and will become "complete in Christ" <Verses refs="Colossians 1:28" />. We are committed to multiplying the godly characteristics of leaders' lives into others <Verses refs="2 Timothy 2:2" />. This multiplication of ministry is key to the healthy growth of the church. We believe the disciples of Jesus Christ should minister to one another in the local church, rather than one or a small number of professional pastors bearing total responsibility to care for the entire congregation. God has given spiritual gifts to all of His people to provide mutual ministry in the context of the healthy and strong local church <Verses refs="Ephesians 4:11-12" />.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              The Lord changes lives and accomplishes His purposes directly through reading and applying the Scriptures, meditating on the truths of the Scriptures, and prayer. The Lord also uses those who minister His Word as they encourage, exhort, admonish, edify, implore, reprove, rebuke, and console others toward godliness. God needs no new or unique insight into the human condition in order to change lives, regardless of whether that insight is gained through psychology or some other tool of human origin. Problems that are approached by integrating the Scriptures with psychological theories tend to deceive individuals into diminishing the God of the Scriptures and into believing that He has not provided and cannot provide sufficient truth, insight, and wisdom that will change their lives <Verses refs="Colossians 2:8-10" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              When psychology and other social sciences step beyond observing human behavior and seek to explain the causes of human behavior, they enter spiritual territory. Only the God of the Scriptures can explain causes and offer solutions that lead to godliness and a fruitful, joyful life. God has given us everything we need for life and godliness <Verses refs="2 Peter 1:3" />. He changes us as we discipline ourselves through obedience to the Word of God in the power of the Holy Spirit <Verses refs="1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Peter 1:5-11" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              Each Christian's passion should be to become more like Christ and fulfill the Great Commandment to love the Lord with the entire heart, soul, mind, and might <Verses refs="Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:2; Deuteronomy 6:5; Mark 12:30; Matthew 22:37-38" />.

              Satan and his demonic servants viciously oppose the work God performs in and through His people <Verses refs="1 Peter 5:8; Genesis 3:1-7; Ephesians 6:12" />.

              We believe in the total deity of the Lord.
            </div>
            <div>
              We believe God created the universe in six twenty-four hour days and that before He created the universe, nothing except God existed <Verses refs="Genesis 1; Exodus 31:17; Psalm 33:6-9; Acts 17:24; Hebrews 11:3; Colossians 1:16" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              God chose to create the universe and all that is in it to reveal His glory, divine nature, eternal power, infinite wisdom, and supreme authority <Verses refs="Isaiah 43:7; Psalm 19:1-2; Jeremiah 10:12; Romans 1:20; Revelation 4:11" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              We deny the theory of evolution, which states that nonliving substances gave rise to the first living material, which then reproduced and diversified to produce all living creatures. We believe that all people are descendants of Adam and Eve, whom God created personally and individually and as complete human beings <Verses refs="Genesis 1:26-27; Genesis 2:7; Genesis 2:21-22; 1 Corinthians 11:8-9" />. The fall of Adam and Eve infected all people with sin and death, but the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ gives the opportunity to receive God's gift of eternal life <Verses refs="Romans 5:18-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              God rules over His creation and cares about and is involved in the lives of individual people <Verses refs="Job 12:10; Acts 17:25; Acts 25:28; Colossians 1:17; Hebrews 1:13; Ephesians 4:6" />.

          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              Baptism and communion are the two ordinances required in the church. We believe that Christian baptism by immersion in water is a public identification with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. Although baptism is not required for salvation, it is commanded of all believers and is for believers only <Verses refs="Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 2:38, 2:41; Acts 18:8" />. Scripture shows that a person was baptized after personally receiving forgiveness of sin through accepting Jesus Christ. Water baptism is a symbol of our death to sin, burial, and resurrection to newness of life that happens when we become new creations in Christ <Verses refs="Colossians 2:12; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Romans 6:1-4" />.
            </div>
            <div>
              Communion is the commemoration by believers of Christ's death, and a reminder—through the bread and the juice—of the Savior's broken body and shed blood. Communion is to be a time of confession of our sin and should be preceded by careful self-examination according to <Verses refs="Acts 4:13; Romans 6:3-6; 1 Corinthians 11:20-29" />.

              Vertical Church is committed to the Bible's teaching that men who hold the offices of Elder and Deacon are to oversee various functions of the local church.
            </div>
            <div>
              The Bible's teaching on the subject of two church offices is found in <Verses refs="1 Timothy 3:1-16" /> and <Verses refs="Titus 1:5-9" />. Although there are three terms used for the offices of the church: bishop, elder, and deacon, analysis of these terms indicates that bishop and elder are used interchangeably.

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Elder Qualifications</h4>
          <div className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <Verses refs="Titus 1:6-9" />: Above reproach, able to teach, husband to one wife, not addicted to wine, temperate, not antagonistic, prudent, uncontentious, respectable, free from the love of money, hospitable, manage own household, not a new convert.
          </div>

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Elder Duties</h4>
          <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            <div>
              The Scriptures show that the elders serve by leading and that their responsibility involves the spiritual oversight of the congregation. All elders are equal in authority but not necessarily equal in influence.
            </div>
            <div>The elders' primary responsibilities include:</div>
            <div>
              <strong>Doctrine</strong> – Ensuring that the doctrine of the church is biblical; all doctrinal issues in the church will be settled by the Board of Elders.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>Direction</strong> – Ensuring that the direction of the church is consistent with the Vertical Church statement of purpose and the Four Pillars.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>Discipline</strong> – Administering in love and humility the process of church discipline as outlined in <Verses refs="Matthew 18:15-20; Galatians 6:1-4; Titus 3:10; 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15; 1 Timothy 5:17-25; 1 Corinthians 5; 2 Corinthians 2:5-11" />, and <Verses refs="Romans 16:17" />.
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Plurality of Elders</h4>
          <div className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            The Scriptures teach that a plurality of elders governed individual New Testament churches <Verses refs="Acts 14:23; Acts 20:28; Titus 1:5; Philippians 1:1" />. The Scripture does not mention any congregations featuring a stand-alone pastor and leader. A plurality of godly elders, exercising their individual giftedness, aligns with the Scripture's teaching that wisdom is found in a multitude of godly counselors <Verses refs="Proverbs 11:14; Proverbs 12:15; Proverbs 15:22; Proverbs 19:20; Proverbs 24:6" />. This truth does not eliminate the possibility and likelihood that one or more elders will stand out from the others as more public in their ministries or more influential in their workings on the Elder Board.
          </div>

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Senior Pastor</h4>
          <div className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            The Vertical Church Senior Pastor automatically serves as an elder and, because of his public presence and responsibility before the congregation, may be considered first among equals as a member of the Elder Board. The Senior Pastor should be gifted primarily as a preacher/teacher and as a leader.
          </div>

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Deacons</h4>
          <div className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80">
            The Bible teaches that deacons lead by serving <Verses refs="Acts 6" />. The qualifications for elders and deacons are the same regarding an individual's character, but they differ in aptitude. The elders are to be able to teach while the deacons are to be able and proved as servants.
          </div>

          <h4 className="mb-3 mt-8 font-heading text-base font-semibold text-navy">Deacon Qualifications</h4>
          <div className="mb-2 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-navy/80"><Verses refs="1 Timothy 3:8-12" /></div>

            <div>
              Vertical Church affirms the God-ordained and significant role that women should play in establishing and leading the local church. Every leadership opportunity is open to women except those that are excluded by Scripture. The Scriptures clearly state that men are to serve in the office of Elder and that women are not to serve in church positions in which they exercise authority over men or in which they teach doctrine to men <Verses refs="1 Timothy 2:12; 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Titus 1:6-9" />. We do not see this as an issue of equality, for men and women are equal under God. The Bible is clear that men and women do not have the same roles. Qualified women should serve in any leadership position that is not forbidden in the Scriptures.

            <div>
              We believe in the importance of serving the body of Christ by offering clear paths for people to start and develop healthy and growing relationships with others in the church body. We value an intentional plan to help every interested person enjoy godly relationships in the church. Church membership is a byproduct of people who are growing in Christ and who grasp the importance of serving the Lord by using their gifts to serve others in the local church.
